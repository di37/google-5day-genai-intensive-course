You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

Far from being a mere culinary ingredient, the olive tree and its fruit have played a significant role in shaping our history, culture, economy, and even our health. In modern society, the olive continues to hold immense importance, impacting various facets of our lives, from agriculture and trade to gastronomy and environmental sustainability. \n\nOne of the most prominent contributions of olives lies in their **economic significance**. Olive cultivation and production represent a major agricultural sector in numerous countries, particularly in the Mediterranean region. Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia are among the world's largest olive producers, generating substantial revenue and employment opportunities. The olive industry encompasses a wide range of activities, from farming and harvesting to oil extraction, processing, and packaging.  Moreover, the global trade in olive oil and table olives contributes significantly to international commerce, fostering economic interdependence and cultural exchange. The growing demand for high-quality olive oil, particularly extra virgin olive oil, has spurred innovation in production techniques and quality control, further boosting the economic value of this ancient crop.\n\nBeyond its economic impact, the olive holds a central place in the **culinary traditions** of many cultures.

With a flick of her tail, she darted past Granny's legs, her paws a blur against the sun-drenched patio. The world exploded in color and sound - a cacophony of unfamiliar sights and smells. A plump robin hopped along a fence, its red breast a beacon against the green. A fat bumblebee buzzed past, its wings a blur of golden motion.\n\nMittens, a seasoned hunter in her own right, pursued a butterfly with the tenacity of a warrior, its wings a kaleidoscope of colors against the blue sky. The chase led her through a maze of flowerbeds, past a giggling child on a swing, and into a secret, sun-dappled garden behind Granny's house.\n\nHere, she encountered the residents of the garden – a gruff, grumpy hedgehog with a prickly coat, a family of chattering squirrels with bushy tails, and a wise old toad, his skin the color of moss, who told tales of the world beyond the garden walls. The stories sparked a fire in Mittens' heart, a yearning for adventure, for the unknown.\n\nSuddenly, a shadow fell over the garden. A menacing, black crow, its beady eyes gleaming with malice, descended upon a plump, unsuspecting worm. Mittens, her hunter instincts taking over, launched into action, her sleek body a blur of grey and white. The crow, startled, let out a screech and flapped away. The worm, saved, wriggled gratefully in the soft earth.\n\nThe creatures of the garden, witnessing Mittens' bravery, greeted her as a hero. The hedgehog, his frown softened, offered her a juicy slug. The squirrels shared their stash of nuts. The toad, with a knowing wink, told her tales of a legendary lost treasure, hidden deep in the woods beyond the garden.\n\nEmboldened by their encouragement, Mittens knew what she had to do. With a determined meow, she set off into the woods, her adventurous spirit soaring. The garden, her safe haven, would always be waiting, but the world beyond beckoned, and Mittens, the brave tabby cat, was ready to explore.
