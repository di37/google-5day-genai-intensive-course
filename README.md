# 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google

## Prerequisites

- Kaggle Account (phone verified)
- Google API Key from AI Studio
- Basic Python knowledge
- Internet connectivity for API access

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `google-generativeai>=0.8.3`, `tensorflow`, `keras` libraries
- Kaggle notebook environment.

## Day 1 - Prompt Engineering

Day 1 of Google's Generative AI course focuses on mastering the Gemini API and advanced prompting techniques. The course begins with a comprehensive introduction to the Gemini API setup using Kaggle notebooks, making it accessible for hands-on learning. Participants learn about various prompting techniques, from basic zero-shot prompting to more advanced methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) and the ReAct framework. The course covers essential concepts such as model selection, generation parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p), and output control. A significant portion is dedicated to code-related features, including code generation, execution, and explanation capabilities of the Gemini API. The practical examples and real-world applications, demonstrated through tools like TextFX and SQL Talk, help bridge the gap between theory and implementation. Whether you're new to Gen AI or have experience with other models like ChatGPT, this course provides valuable insights into leveraging Google's Gemini API effectively. The day concludes with comprehensive resources and best practices for continued learning and development.

## Day 2 - Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases

Day 2 of Googleâ€™s Generative AI course dives into embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a deep understanding of these foundational components. The day begins with a detailed exploration of embeddings, including text, image, and multimodal embeddings, helping participants understand how these representations capture semantic relationships in vector space. Practical examples walk learners through the classification of embeddings using Keras, highlighting essential techniques for implementing similarity scoring and optimizing vector search. The course also covers Retrieval-Augmented Generation, demonstrating how to use embeddings with RAG for accurate, context-aware document-based Q&A. To bridge theory and application, participants engage with hands-on assignments that reinforce these concepts in real-world scenarios. By the end of the day, participants are well-equipped with tools and techniques to harness embeddings and RAG for enhanced AI solutions.
