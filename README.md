## Day 1

Day 1 of Google's Generative AI course focuses on mastering the Gemini API and advanced prompting techniques. The course begins with a comprehensive introduction to the Gemini API setup using Kaggle notebooks, making it accessible for hands-on learning. Participants learn about various prompting techniques, from basic zero-shot prompting to more advanced methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) and the ReAct framework. The course covers essential concepts such as model selection, generation parameters (temperature, top-k, top-p), and output control. A significant portion is dedicated to code-related features, including code generation, execution, and explanation capabilities of the Gemini API. The practical examples and real-world applications, demonstrated through tools like TextFX and SQL Talk, help bridge the gap between theory and implementation. Whether you're new to Gen AI or have experience with other models like ChatGPT, this course provides valuable insights into leveraging Google's Gemini API effectively. The day concludes with comprehensive resources and best practices for continued learning and development.
