# Bonus Day: Extra API Features to Try

This notebook explores advanced features of the **Google Gemini API**, focusing on integrating multimedia data (audio, video, and text) and leveraging advanced capabilities such as streaming responses, context caching, and file-based interactions.

---

## Introduction

This notebook demonstrates advanced usage of the Google Gemini API through real-world examples. It illustrates how to:

- Analyze multimedia content (audio, video, and text).
- Leverage advanced features like context caching to improve efficiency.
- Use streaming responses for interactive applications.

The notebook is an extension of a 5-day learning journey, showcasing how to maximize the Gemini platformâ€™s potential for AI-driven applications.

## Features and Examples

### 1. **Audio Analysis**

#### Example:

- **Input**: A speech audio file of John F. Kennedy's inaugural address.
- **Prompt**: _"Who made the following speech? What were they positive about?"_
- **Results**:
  ```
  That was John F. Kennedy delivering his State of the Union address on January 30, 1961.
  In his speech, Kennedy expressed optimism about the American people's willingness to face challenges, the strength of the US's monetary and financial position, and the potential for cooperation with other nations, even adversaries, in areas of mutual interest such as space exploration.
  ```

#### Interpretation:

- The model successfully identifies the speaker and highlights key themes of optimism and cooperation. This demonstrates the API's ability to combine speech recognition and semantic analysis.

### 2. **Video Understanding**

#### Example:

- **Input**: The _Big Buck Bunny_ short film.
- **Prompt**: _"What characters are in this movie?"_
- **Results**:
  ```
  This is Big Buck Bunny. The characters shown are:
  - Big Buck Bunny (a large rabbit)
  - A bird (purple)
  - A squirrel (brown)
  - A chinchilla (gray)
  ```

#### Interpretation:

- The API identifies characters accurately, reflecting its capability to extract meaningful visual content. This could be extended to video summaries, scene analysis, or caption generation for accessibility tools.

### 3. **Streaming Responses**

#### Example:

- **Prompt**: _"Write an essay defending why dogs are the best animals. Treat the essay as serious and include proper essay structure."_
- **Results**:

  ```
  ## The Unwavering Loyalty of Canis Familiaris: A Defense of Dogs' Supremacy

  Dogs combine loyalty, adaptability, and contributions to human society. Their deep emotional connections, versatility in roles, and historical significance make them irreplaceable companions.
  ```

#### Interpretation:

- The essay streamed in real time, showcasing the API's ability to generate structured, meaningful content incrementally. This is particularly useful for interactive writing applications.

---

### 4. **Context Caching**

#### Example:

- **Input**: Apollo 11 mission transcript uploaded and cached for efficient querying.
- **Prompt**: _"Find a nice moment from this transcript."_
- **Results**:
  ```
  A humorous exchange between Buzz Aldrin and Charlie Duke:
  Buzz: "I wanted to be 18 or 20 pounds above nominal, babe."
  Charlie: "Sorry about that."
  ```

#### Interpretation:

- The model efficiently retrieves cached context, saving tokens and improving response speed. This feature is ideal for working with large datasets like research papers or transcripts.
