# Operationalizing Generative AI on Vertex AI using MLOps

This repository contains insights and best practices from the whitepaper "Operationalizing Generative AI on Vertex AI using MLOps." It covers the lifecycle of generative AI systems, foundational models, and MLOps practices tailored to GenAI applications on Google's Vertex AI platform.

---

## **Introduction**

The rise of foundational models and generative AI has transformed AI system development, introducing challenges such as:

- Selecting appropriate models.
- Optimizing prompts.
- Grounding outputs in real-world data.
- Optimizing infrastructure for high performance.

This repository focuses on adapting MLOps principles to operationalize generative AI applications on Vertex AI.

## **Core Concepts**

### DevOps vs. MLOps

- **DevOps**: Bridges development and operations with automation and continuous improvement.
- **MLOps**: Extends DevOps for machine learning by incorporating:
  - Data validation.
  - Model evaluation and monitoring.
  - Experiment tracking and reproducibility.

---

## **Lifecycle of Generative AI Systems**

1. **Discovery**: Identify and evaluate suitable foundation models.
2. **Development & Experimentation**: Iteratively refine using prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and chaining.
3. **Deployment**: Manage and operationalize artifacts like prompt templates, embeddings, and fine-tuned adapters.
4. **Evaluation**: Automate metrics-driven evaluation.
5. **Governance**: Ensure transparency, control, and accountability across the system.

## **Key Practices**

### Prompt Engineering

- Prompts combine instructions, context, and examples.
- Treated as both data and code, requiring:
  - Iterative refinement.
  - Versioning and tracking.

### Chaining and Augmentation

- **Chains**: Connect multiple models, APIs, and logic into workflows.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Ground outputs with external data to reduce hallucinations.
- **Agents**: Enable LLMs to interact with tools and APIs for real-time decisions.

### Model Tuning and Training

Vertex AI supports:

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**.
2. **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**.
3. **Distillation** for efficient, smaller models.

### Data Practices

- Adapt foundation models using prompts, few-shot examples, and grounding data.
- Generate and augment synthetic data for improved performance.
- Implement robust data pipelines for governance and lifecycle management.

---

## **Evaluation and Monitoring**

- Automate evaluation metrics for reliability and scalability.
- Monitor for drift, skew, and performance degradation.
- Use Vertex AI tools like Model Evaluation and Pipelines for comprehensive monitoring.

---

## **Deployment**

### Types of Deployment:

1. **GenAI Systems**: Full applications with models, APIs, and databases.
2. **Foundation Models**: Large, multi-purpose models optimized for specific use cases.

### Best Practices:

- Implement CI/CD pipelines.
- Optimize models with quantization and distillation.
- Track versions and artifacts for reproducibility.

---

## **Governance**

Ensure lifecycle governance for:

- Data.
- Models (foundation and fine-tuned).
- Chain components and artifacts.
  Use tools like Dataplex, Vertex ML Metadata, and Vertex Experiment for centralized governance.

## **Vertex AI Capabilities**

### Key Tools and Components

1. **Vertex Model Garden**: Curated repository of 150+ models for discovery, fine-tuning, and deployment.
2. **Vertex AI Studio**: Integrated environment for prototyping, tuning, and deploying models.
3. **Training & Tuning**: Comprehensive support for full-scale training and fine-tuning techniques.
4. **Chaining & Augmentation**:
   - RAG and agent-based approaches.
   - Grounding and external API integrations.
5. **Evaluation Tools**:
   - Vertex AI Experiments and TensorBoard for tracking and visualization.
